### Speech Title: Our Recent Research on Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems

**Abstract:** This talk consists of two parts. The first part presents an overview of our recent research on
cooperative control of multi-agent systems, including event-triggered cooperative control, coverage control
and entrapping control, cooperative control under communication delays, cooperative adaptive control with
unknown agent dynamics, and cooperative control under DoS attacks. The second part presents a particular
work on finite-time cooperative output regulation for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems under DoS
attacks. A novel distributed finite-time observer is first proposed for each agent to estimate the state of the
exosystem by taking into consideration of DoS attacks. Then, a novel distributed resilient finite-time controller
is further developed. It is shown that the regulated output semi-globally converges to zero in finite time. In
addition, an explicit upper bound for the finite convergence time of the regulated outputs is provided. Finally,
a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

### Speech Title: Recent Advancement in Smart Manufacturing Research at KTH
**Abstract:**
Smart manufacturing depends on the timely acquisition, distribution, and utilisation of information
from machines and processes from manufacturing shop floors and across product lifecycles. Effective
information sharing can improve production quality, reliability, resource efficiency and the recyclability of
end-of-life products. Smart manufacturing built on digitalisation and AI also aims for better sustainability. As
emerging technologies, cyber-physical systems, digital twins and human-centric collaborative assembly
provide new opportunities to achieve the goals of smart manufacturing. Within the context, this presentation
will focus on AI in Manufacturing (AIM) and cover the following topics:
* A brief intro to relevant background
* Latest advancement and future opportunities of smart manufacturing
* Showcases and future research directions

While advanced AI methods show great promise in smart manufacturing, challenges and future trends remain
to be identified and will be highlighted in the presentation.

### Speech Title: Multimodal Perception and Understanding in Embodied AI Systems
**Abstract:** Aiming at the research frontiers and national needs of multimodal intelligent systems and Embodied
AI systems, we focuses on solving the basic theory and application of multimodal perception and
understanding. At first, an innovative method for analyzing coupled multimodal emotional features based on
broad-deep networks is proposed to overcome the technical bottleneck of integrating different modal features.
And then, we construct an intention understanding model based on fuzzy deep neural networks, revealing the
quantitative relationship between multimodal emotions and personal intentions. In addition, an informationdriven based natural interaction method is proposed, which solves the problem of feedback on intentions. The
proposals are applied in the Embodied AI systems, including emotional robot systems, intelligent recognition
and control system for geological/coal mine drilling process, and intelligent prediction and control system of
plate shape for iron and steel metallurgy process, where perception and understanding of multimodal
information are realized.

### Speech Title: Dynamic Average Consensus over Asymmetric Networks: A New Integral Surplus-Based Approach
**Abstract:** Motivated by the engineering task of cooperative encirclement for dynamic non-cooperative targets,
this study identifies the key scientific problem of dynamic average consensus over asymmetric networks. To
this end, a new integral surplus-based framework is established. By analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the networked matrix, this framework resolves the challenge of center estimation in multi-target cooperative
encirclement over directed networks. As a further extension, an “integral surplus + state decomposition”
privacy-preserving communication mechanism is designed to tackle communication privacy and security
concerns. Subsequently, considering spatiotemporal coordination accuracy, an “integral surplus + prescribedtime” cooperative planning and formation-based tracking control scheme is developed. Finally, the proposed
approach is applied to the high-precision, timed and positioned space flying net cooperative encirclement
mission for dynamic non-cooperative targets.

### Speech Title: Recent Study on Preventive Maintenance for Complex Industrial Systems
**Abstract:** This report examines active safety for complex industrial systems, with remaining useful life (RUL)
prediction as the foundation for preventive maintenance and risk-aware decision making. The discussion is
organized around some persistent challenges. First, information insufficiency: limited labels, domain shifts,
and unknown operating conditions require strategies that make effective use of small, heterogeneous datasets
while respecting data sovereignty and facilitating privacy-preserving collaboration. Second, focusing on model
robustness and sensitivity, performance is improved and computational costs are reduced by optimizing data
input and model configuration. Third, information integration: multi-source fusion and spatiotemporal
coupling are leveraged to capture early-warning cues and extend prediction horizons. Finally, pathways are
articulated for translating RUL estimates into maintenance scheduling, and life-extension policies operational
management.

### Speech Title: Motion Intention Recognition and Compliant Interactive Control for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Robot
**Abstract:** In recent years, the number of patients with movement disorders caused by stroke, spinal cord injury,
head trauma and other factors has increased rapidly, and the demand for rehabilitation training has risen sharply.
As a new means of rehabilitation training, lower limb rehabilitation robot can effectively save rehabilitation
medical resources and improve rehabilitation efficiency. The active rehabilitation training based on the subjects’
motion intention is conducive to improving their enthusiasm to participate in the training. The human-machine
hybrid system of lower limb rehabilitation robot is a tightly coupled interactive system. How to accurately
identify the motion intention of human lower limb and provide an active, flexible and transparent interactive
training environment for patients at different recovery stages or with different motion abilities is of great
importance to improve the efficiency and effect of rehabilitation training. This report will focus on the human
motion intention recognition and human-robot collaborative interactive control.
